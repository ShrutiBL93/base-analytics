### #### Combustion optimization
###############################################

Description: 

Data from a combustion chamber is provided.
We need to predict what factors affect the oxygen concentration at the exit.

The other variables have descriptions in the variable names.

Target Variable: O2 AT ECONOMIZER INLET_QCR_06704

Questions:

1. Use factor analysis on the dataset by leaving out oxygen and identify number of latent factors.

2. Use cluster analysis and identify how many clusters exists, and list the top five dominating characteristics of each cluster.

2. Build a regression model to predict oxygen and document the entire process from data exploration to model building and validation.
